	class DKApplicationInterface;
	/// @brief This is optional application entry point class.
	/// @details
	/// You can use this class for creating application one-sourced, cross-platform.
	/// You need subclass of this class to override application behaviors.
	/// You can have multiple instances of this class, but only one instance can run,
	/// other instances will be blocked until previous instance has finished run.
	/// This class provides retrieving process environments information.
	///
	/// Subclass note:
	/// 1. Override OnInitialize(). this is called when application to be
	///    initialized. You may need create single or multiple window(s)
	///    (as DKWindow), and screen (DKScreen) objects to attached into a window.
	///    One screen instance per one. But this is optional.
	///    You don't have to create windows, screens if your application does not
	///    need window to display. (ie console application).
	///    Whether your application has window or not, an application will have
	///    main loop (DKEventLoop) and looping till Terminate() has called.
	/// 2. Override OnTerminate(). this is called when application terminated by
	///    calling Terminate(). Your cleanup operations must be here.
	///    (destory windows, destroy screens, closing files, etc.)
	///
	/// @note
	///   Using this class is optional. You can initialize window, screen at any
	///   time. If your application runs with other UI tools, and you want to
	///   use DKLib together, you can create proxy window with created from other UI
	///   tools, and you can create and attach screen into that window.
	///
	///   On some platforms (macOS, iOS includes) a window object should be created
	///   on main thread.
	///
	///   On iOS, calling Terminate() will terminate current process and will not
	///   escape into entry function(main). But other desktop OSes does not.
	///
	/// @note
	///   You can set iOS/OSX application delegate by setting SystemConfig.
	///   - For iOS:\n
	///       DKPropertySet::SystemConfig().SetValue("UIApplicationDelegate", "MyAppDelegate");
	///   - For macOS:\n
	///       DKPropertySet::SystemConfig().SetValue("NSApplicationDelegate", "MyAppDelegate");
	///   - For both:\n
	///       DKPropertySet::SystemConfig().SetValue("AppDelegate", "MyAppDelegate"); \n
	///   these properties must be set before calling DKApplication::Run().
